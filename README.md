![Tests](https://github.com/twitu/mnist-solver-pro-max/actions/workflows/model_tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification using PyTorch. The model achieves >99.4% validation accuracy while maintaining a lightweight architecture (<20K parameters) through efficient use of modern deep learning techniques.

## Model Architecture
The network architecture incorporates several key features:
- Three sequential blocks with convolutional layers
- Batch Normalization for training stability
- Dropout (0.1) for regularization
- Global Average Pooling to reduce parameters
- 1x1 convolutions for channel dimension reduction
